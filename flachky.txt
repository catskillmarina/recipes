READY IN: 2hrs 15mins	SERVES: 12
UNITS: US
INGREDIENTS Nutrition
2 large onions
2 stalks celery, halved
2 large carrots, sliced
3 lbs tripe
2 tablespoons maggi seasoning (optional)
2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns
2 teaspoons whole allspice
1 tablespoon marjoram
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1⁄2 teaspoon paprika
2 bay leaves
1⁄3 cup flour

DIRECTIONS
wash tripe, cut in 1/3in strips, no more than 3in long.
in large soup pot, saute whole onion, celery and carrot until golden.
add tripe, and 6-7c water, enough to cover.
add maggi (optional), salt, marjoram, nutmeg, paprika, bay leaf, pepper and allspice. I reccomend putting your whole pepper and allspice in either a tea ball, or in cheese cloth, otherwise this soup gets difficult to eat when you have to pick out the spices.
cook for 1-2 hours until trip is tender, not soft and mushy.
make a roux. Fry 1/3c flour over high heat until it turns light brown. Take some liquid out of the soup, mix the roux into that liquid, and add the mixture back.
Serve with rye bread.
