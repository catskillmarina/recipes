Set rice on to cook.

Cut the scallions in thinish rings.

Cut tofu into 3/4 in cubes reserving the brine.

Fry mushrooms til brown cutting them with a spatula
while frying. Be sure they are carmelized.

Add tofu cubes - fry for a little while.

Season well with Basil and Thyme.

Add Scallions - fry some more.

Add enough miso to season well.
