Ingredients
-----------
1 Pack of firm/extrafirm tofu
several tbsp vegetable oil , divided
1 large onion (or 2 small onions), sliced
300 g / 10 oz mushrooms , sliced (not too thin)
40 g / 3 tbsp butter
2 tbsp flour (Note 2)
2 cups / 500 ml veggie broth
1 cup dry white wine
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
150 ml / 2/3 cup sour cream
Salt and pepper

250 - 300 g / 8 - 10 oz pasta or egg noodles of choice (Note 3)
Chopped chives , for garnish (optional)

Directions:

Cut onions thin and small.
Cut mushrooms into slices.

Brown all tofu in butter. Divide it up into batches so all of it is 
properly browned. Add salt and pepper as you brown tofu.

Get egg noodles cooked and drained.

Brown and carmelize onions.
Add mushrooms and brown them - really do it well.
Add some wine, reduce and brown
When wine is gone, add more.
When wine is used up brown and dry the mushrooms more in the pan.
Cook mushrooms until golden. Scrape bottom of fry pan to get all the golden 
bits off (this is flavour!).

Add flour, cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

Add half the broth while stirring. Once incorporated, add remaining broth.

Stir, then add sour cream and mustard. Stir until incorporated 
(don't worry if it looks split, sour cream will "melt" as it heats).

Bring to simmer ,then reduce heat to medium low. Once it thickens to the 
consistency of pouring cream (3 - 5 minutes), adjust salt and pepper to taste.

Add tofu back in (including plate juices). Simmer then remove from stove 
immediately. (Note 4)

Serve over egg noodes.
